# CRUD APPLICATION
I built this project to practice and demonstrate CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The app is a simple notes manager where you can add, edit, delete, and view notes.  Backend: Node.js + Express  Database: SQLite (with better-sqlite3 for faster queries)  Frontend: Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (using Fetch API)
